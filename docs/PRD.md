# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Name: **RedactX** (Java Library for PII Redaction)

---

## 1. **Purpose**

Build a Java-native library for automated detection and redaction of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in unstructured and semi-structured text. The library will prioritize enterprise use cases with high performance, configurability, auditability, and developer-friendliness.

---

## 2. **Problem Statement**

Existing solutions like Presidio (Python-based) are powerful but often:
- Are difficult to integrate in JVM environments
- Require additional infra setup (e.g., microservices, REST APIs)
- Lack streaming and enterprise document support
- Are not easily configurable or auditable out of the box

Java-first enterprises (banks, telecoms, compliance-heavy orgs) need an embedded solution that is light, fast, and extensible.

---

## 3. **Goals & Objectives**

- Provide accurate and extensible detection of PII (names, emails, phone numbers, etc.)
- Offer redaction strategies: masking, removal, tokenization
- Be easy to integrate into JVM-based applications
- Support structured and unstructured text, logs, and documents (e.g., PDFs, DOCX)
- Enable configuration and customization without code changes
- Provide audit trails and detailed redaction metadata

---

## 4. **Target Users**

| Role | Needs |
|------|-------|
| Java developers | Embed redaction into backend services |
| Data engineers | Redact sensitive info from logs, chat data, export pipelines |
| Compliance teams | Verify, audit, and enforce data minimization |
| ML teams | Preprocess training data by tokenizing PII |

---

## 5. **Key Features (MVP)**

### 1. **PII Detectors**
- Regex-based: Email, phone, credit card, SSN, IP
- NER-based: Person, Organization, Location (via OpenNLP/CoreNLP)
- Pluggable `Detector` interface for extensibility

### 2. **Redaction Strategies**
- Mask (e.g., `[REDACTED]`)
- Remove (delete entity)
- Tokenize (e.g., `<PERSON_1>`)
- Configurable via builder or YAML

### 3. **Audit Logging & Metadata**
- Return list of redacted entities with start/end position, confidence, type
- Optional logging to JSON or audit system

### 4. **Document & Log Redaction Support**
- Input: Plaintext, JSON, CSV, XML
- Optional: PDF, DOCX, XLSX via Apache POI and PDFBox

### 5. **Developer-Focused API**
- Java Builder Pattern for easy setup
- One-liner redaction pipeline
- CLI and library interface

### 6. **Language & Locale Support**
- English (MVP)
- Configurable pipeline for multilingual support in later versions

## 6. **Differentiators vs Existing Tools**

| Feature | RedactX | Presidio | Amazon Comprehend | PII-Transformers |
|---------|---------|----------|--------------------|------------------|
| Java-native | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Lightweight/Embedded | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Custom config (YAML) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Structured document support | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Streaming / log integration | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| Audit trails | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ |
| Deterministic tokenization | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ |
| Enterprise integrations | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |

---

## 7. **Non-Goals**

- Full ML model training pipelines (future)
- Real-time cloud service (this is a library, not SaaS)
- UI dashboard for redactions (CLI and logs suffice for MVP)

---

## 8. **Tech Stack**

- Java 11+
- OpenNLP / CoreNLP for NER
- Apache POI / PDFBox for document support
- SLF4J for logging
- YAML parser (SnakeYAML)

---

## 9. **Success Metrics**

- Integration in at least 3 pilot enterprise apps
- Precision and recall benchmarks against Presidio (match or beat)
- Under 100ms redaction for a 500-word input
- Configurable and auditable output verified by compliance users

---

## 10. **Future Scope**

- Multilingual PII support (e.g., Indian languages)
- Cloud/Hybrid deployment model
- Redactor for images (OCR + NLP)
- Integration with Apache Kafka and Flink
- HIPAA 18 identifier preset
- Visual redaction diffs for audit review

---

## 11. **Risks & Assumptions**

- Reliance on Java ecosystem adoption
- Accuracy of NER models out of the box
- Complexity of parsing and redacting binary formats (PDF, DOCX)

---

## 12. **Timeline (Tentative)**

| Milestone | Timeline |
|----------|----------|
| MVP API + Regex Detectors | Week 1-2 |
| NER Detector Integration | Week 3 |
| Redaction Strategies + Audit Logging | Week 4 |
| Structured Inputs (CSV/JSON) | Week 5 |
| CLI Tool + YAML Config Support | Week 6 |
| Document Support (POI/PDFBox) | Week 7-8 |
| Internal Pilot + Feedback | Week 9 |

---

## 13. **Team**
- Product Lead: TBD
- Engineering: TBD
- Compliance Advisor: TBD

---

## 14. **Open Questions**
- Should redaction strategies be pluggable like detectors?
- How should deterministic tokenization be handled (via hash or lookup)?
- What should the default audit format be—JSON or plain text?
